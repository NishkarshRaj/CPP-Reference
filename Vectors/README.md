# Vectors in C++

* Abstract Data Type
**Logically a Dynamic Array with Linked List notations -> Start before first element and Null (End) after last element**
* Header file: <vector> but <bits/stdc++.h> contains both iostream and vector

**Note:** Sorting is fastest if vectors are used!!! They save both time complexity due to quickness and space complexity because of dynamic nature
