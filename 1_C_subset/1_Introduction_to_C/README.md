# C overview
* Middle level language (between high level and assembly languages)
* Founded by Dennis Ritchie
* Portable
* No run time exception handling like high level languages
* Allows type casting and argument promotion
* System programming is allowed accessing the pointers, addresses etc.
* Only 32 keywords

# C is a structured language
* It is not a **block structured** language because it does not support defining functions within functions.
* It **compartmentalizes** the code into blocks ({}) using local variables etc. which restricts visibility of the code: We know what the subroutine does and not how does it works which is a feature of OOPS based languages like C++.
* Control transferred using looping and functions and use of goto statement is discouraged
* Does not follow **Static field concept** which allows statements to be present anywhere on yhe line rather than following indentation.
* C's main structural component and only subroutine are functions though compartmentalization can also be done using **code blocks** {}

# C is a programmer's language

1. C replaces Assembly Language codes with almost same accuracy, efficiency and flexibility
* Disadvantages of Assembly programming
	* Difficult
	* Unstructured
	* Not portable
2. System Progrramming
* Operating Systems
* File Handling etc.
3. Generic programming 
Fibonacci codes, calculator etc.
