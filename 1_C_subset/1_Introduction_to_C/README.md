# C overview
* Middle level language (between high level and assembly languages)
* Founded by Dennis Ritchie
* Portable
* No run time exception handling like high level languages
* Allows type casting and argument promotion
* System programming is allowed accessing the pointers, addresses etc.
* Only 32 keywords

# C is a structured language
* It is not a **block structured** language because it does not support defining functions within functions.
* It **compartmentalizes** the code into blocks ({}) using local variables etc. which restricts visibility of the code: We know what the subroutine does and not how does it works which is a feature of OOPS based languages like C++.
